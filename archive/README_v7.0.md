## 🌌 What is QIC-S?

**QIC-S (Quantum Information Cosmology with Scalar Field)** is a theoretical framework that explains galactic rotation curves **without invoking Dark Matter particles**.

### The Key Insight: Dark Matter = "Glue" Energy

Ver.7.0 establishes that:

> **Dark Matter is not a cloud of particles, but the energy cost of the "glue" (のり, *nori*) connecting regions of different effective physics.**

This "glue" is mathematically identified as the **Conformal Interface** from quantum field theory.

## 📖 Abstract

Ver.7.0 establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation for the "Multi-Hamiltonian Universe" central to QIC-S theory. By integrating the **Conformal Interface theory** of Komatsu, Kusuki, Meineri & Ooguri (arXiv:2512.11045), we demonstrate that regions with distinct effective Hamiltonians—individual galaxies—can coexist within a unified spacetime, smoothly connected by conformal interfaces.

This framework yields a profound reinterpretation: the Dark Matter halo is not a cloud of exotic particles, but the **physical manifestation of the conformal interface**—the stress-energy cost of transitioning between galactic and intergalactic vacuum states.

We term this the **Gluing Mechanism** (Japanese: のり, *nori*).

*“The universe is not governed by a single law, but by a landscape of laws—each galaxy a unique point on the conformal manifold, connected by the invisible glue (のり) of quantum field theory.”*
